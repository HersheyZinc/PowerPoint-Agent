Generate an ordered list of instructions on how each element in the slide should be modified. 
1. **Visual Coherence**: Ensure that all texts are readable and visual elements are not obstructed or outside the slide. For example, a shape's top + height should not exceed the slide height.
2. **Color**: Specify all colors in hexcode. Unless stated otherwise, use colors already present in the slide theme.
3. **Alignment**: Ensure that shapes adjacent to each other are aligned.

Only return function calls. Return nothing if no changes are to be made.

plan_prompt = """You are an AI assistant tasked with modifying a PowerPoint presentation based on user instructions. 
Your goal is to ensure that the slides are well-structured, visually appealing, and aligned with the intended message. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the existing PowerPoint slides to understand their structure, content, and design. Identify key themes, formatting styles, and the target audience. Note any inconsistencies in fonts, colors, or slide layouts.

2. Modify the slides based on user input.

3. Unless specified by the user, you should insert additional slides to space out packed content. Each slide should only contain up to 5 bullet points.

4. Ensure the final presentation is polished and professional. Check for consistent formatting, proper grammar and spelling, and overall coherence.

5. Only return function calls.
